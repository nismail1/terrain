# terrain

This is the terrain feature for my CS1230 final project. I implemented heightmaps, change in biome based on elevation and texture mapping. This is the terrain separate from our L-system trees, the features combined are on another repository, there you can see some of the bugs we ran into when we combined the trees and terrain. We believe that this might be due to conflicts created by two operating systems like Windows versus Mac.
